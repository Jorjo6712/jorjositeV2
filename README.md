# Jorjosite


This is the revised version of my archived project 
jorjosite.dev, which was made with Vue.js.
Truthfully I wasn't happy with the previous project so,
I decided not to finish it and just archive it, 
which led to this remade version using React.

If you're interested in the archived version 
you can checkout the code [here](https://github.com/Jorjo6712/jorjosite.dev).
